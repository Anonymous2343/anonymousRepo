AnonymousRepo

Please refer to the "Verifiability" Section 5.3.3.

We provide verifiable results for graphs and tables.
We structure the repository according to the papers structure.

There are 3 kind of files:
 1. function_logs.jsonl (generated by the framework)
 2. edit_distances.txt (generated by the framework)
 3. Python helper scripts to verify the results (generated by ChatGPT for our reviewers)

1. function_logs.jsonl:
   This file contains N=116, N=380, and N>=1500 functions, their respective decompilation, and the compilability and pass flags. Statistics are always averaged over all functions.
2. edit_distance.txt:
   This file contains multiple columns, first and second column are compile and pass ratio, other columns are information about code similarity metrics, GCOV coverage and KLEE coverage.
   Please use the according helper scripts to calculate statistics over other metrics.
3. Statistics.py:
   This file takes a local edit_distances.txt as input, and calculates various statistics.

   hamming_distance.py:
   This script is a TK-inter based GUI, which takes two files per drag-and-drop as input. It calculates hamming distances, and yields information about mismatches with respect to compilability and pass flags.
